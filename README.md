At Braintree, we play ping pong in the office. We wanted a way to track results and assign ratings to players. Elovation was born. It's a simple rails app that tracks the results of any two player game and assigns ratings to the players using the [Elo rating system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).

This also supports individual player rankings within multi-player teams, using the [Trueskill ranking system](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/)
